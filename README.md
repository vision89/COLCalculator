## COL Calculator

Created in 2020 by Dustin Gulley. 
This site was created as a toy app to learn Vue.js. 
Please do not make any moving decisions based on the cost of living calculated here. 

The dataset used to calculate the COL is modified from a dataset contained here https://odn.data.socrata.com/dataset/ODN-Cost-of-Living/d7qh-46tx.

Note that only the 2017 dates were used. 

The algorithm used to calculate distance is a modified version of the algorithm presented here https://www.geodatasource.com/developers/javascript".
